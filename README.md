``` python 
import torch 
```

Ahead of my masters project in machine learning, I thought that it would be a good idea to become familiar w/ pytorch.

My aims:
- [ ] to understand the philosophy of pytorch
  - [ ] why are pytorch tensors useful 
  - [ ] how does autograd work (think DAGs)
  - [ ] gain intuition of workflow for building a model
- [ ] build my own simple network via the docs (no tutorials!)
- [ ] import a large model and fine tune 
- [ ] find a paper with an interesting idea and try and replicate something similar
